Based in the Boston area, MAHacks is a high school hackathon I founded in 2016

I wrote down some of my motivations for starting MAHacks [here](https://mahacks.com/blog/). You can also check out pictures from previous events [here](https://mahacks.com/past-events)

In 2016, disappointed by the small number of hackathons available for high school students in the Boston area at the time, I decided to found my own high school hackathon with a group of friends.

MAHacks was truly a learning experience for me and tested my creativity, organizational and team management skills. As director, I spent countless hours meeting with sponsors, reaching out to mentors, holding team meetings and delegating tasks. I worked to make sure MAHacks was enjoyable, educational, and an event that would introduce newcomers to the wonderful world of hackathons.

Over the course of two years, we grew from ~60 attendees to over 100 by the time I graduated and passed on the directorship.
