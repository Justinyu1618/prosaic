## Description

Dormsp.am is an online platform that aggregates all events happening on MIT campus and displays them in an easy-to-use web interface. The goal is to change how students learn about and interact with events -- rather than sifting through hundreds of emails, they will be able to see all events on a single calendar, filter by category, search by content, get matched with specific events based on personal interest etc.
Tools Used

A script listens in on MIT dormspam (emails circulated to all students) and scrapes incoming emails. We then classify the emails as event or non-event, then extract key information from the event emails such as date, location and even the category of the event. This information is piped up to the front-end where it's organized into a calendar and will display based on user preferences.
